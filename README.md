## Learn Korean With Me ##

Learn Korean With Me is a language learning web application. 

This project was inspired by my interest in learning more about working with a database (PostgreSQL & SQL) along with my interest in learning a new language (Korean). 

### Key Features: ##
Currently, this project consists of: 
- A chat bot feature which guides users through the process of learning new words.
- A game quiz feature which allows users to test their knowledge. 

### Future Developments: ##
I intend to use this project to practice new languages and techniques - in particular:
- Typescript.
- React Hooks.
- ES6 destructuring.
- TDD.

I also intend to implement a points-based system in the quiz feature.

In time, I would love to convert this application to a React Native iOS application!

**Created using:** React, PostgreSQL, Express and SCSS.
