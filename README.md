***Learn Korean With Me*** is a language learning web application. 

This project was inspired by my interest in learning more about working with a database (PostgreSQL & SQL) along with my interest in learning a new language (Korean). 

Currently, this project consists of a chat bot feature which guides users through the process of learning new words. There is also a game quiz feature which allows users to test their knowledge. 

I intend to use this project to practice new languages and techniques - in particular Typescript, React Hooks, ES6 destructuring and TDD. I also intend to implement a points-based system in the quiz feature.

In time, I would love to convert this application to a React Native iOS application!

Created using: React, PostgreSQL, Express and SCSS.
